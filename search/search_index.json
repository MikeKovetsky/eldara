Magic flowed through rivers and whispered in the wind. But peace shattered when the Obsidian Crown, a relic of immense power, was stolen by Morvax, once a noble mage turned dark lord.

To resist, the free kingdoms united: Sylvaris, the shimmering Elven realm hidden within enchanted forests. Ironhold, a formidable Dwarven fortress-city beneath the Stormpeak Mountains. Valorin, the sprawling Human empire known for knights and towering castles. Heroes rise in this turbulent era, driven by glory, treasure, or justice, seeking to reclaim the Obsidian Crown and restore balance\u2014while sinister forces conspire beneath the shadows</p>"}]}
