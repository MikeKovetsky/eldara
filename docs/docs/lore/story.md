In the Age of Dawn, the ancient gods forged Eldara from starfire and shadow, crafting continents of lush forests, towering mountains, and endless seas. Magic flowed through rivers and whispered in the wind.
But peace shattered when the Obsidian Crown, a relic of immense power, was stolen by Morvax, once a noble mage turned dark lord. Wielding forbidden magic, Morvax raised legions of twisted creatures—dragons corrupted, elves shadow-bound, and giants enslaved—spreading ruin across Eldara.
To resist, the free kingdoms united:
Sylvaris, the shimmering Elven realm hidden within enchanted forests.
Ironhold, a formidable Dwarven fortress-city beneath the Stormpeak Mountains.
Valorin, the sprawling Human empire known for knights and towering castles.
Heroes rise in this turbulent era, driven by glory, treasure, or justice, seeking to reclaim the Obsidian Crown and restore balance—while sinister forces conspire beneath the shadows
